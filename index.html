<ul>
<li><i><strong>Family</strong></i> - The experienced i gained from each one of them are meaningful because each one of them felt like a brother/sister to me all the support i gain from them is enough to say that they are my second family.</li>
<li><i><strong>Home</strong></i> - School or the room i've been in the past few months felt like home it a safe space where i can show who i am, learn who i am because of the people inside of the classroom.</li>
<li><i><strong>Friends/SchoolMates</strong></i> - So many of them i cant even know the numbers of the people i met each one extraordinary kind, brave and fun to be with.</li>
<li><i><strong>Teachers</strong></i> - My Second parent that teach me meaningful education help me grow as a person they're the ones i look up to the most wanting to follow there footsteps teaching as a teacher.</li>
<li><i><strong>NSHSS Logo</strong></i> - A symbol of where i came from after i graduate i hope so because of the memories i experience fun ones, sad ones, frustrations and many more to come.</li>
